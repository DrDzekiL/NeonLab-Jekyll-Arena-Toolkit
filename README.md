A minimal but structured automation toolkit built inside the **NeonLab / Arena** system.  
Designed for analysts, system builders and automation architects who value **clarity, repeatability and clean logs**.

This toolkit forms the technical basement of the **Arena** workflow —  
where market routines, logging, scanning and auxiliary tasks converge into a single automation layer.
